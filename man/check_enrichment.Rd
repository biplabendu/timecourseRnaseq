\arguments{
\item{geneset}{A character vector of gene names of interest that you want to run functional enrichment on.}

\item{what}{Which functional annotation to run enrichment for? Select from "GOs", "pfams", "signalP", "TMHMM" or user-defined column name. The default is "GOs".}

\item{function.dir}{Specify the path/to/the/directory that contains the folder "functions". The default is "."}

\item{path_to_annot}{Specify the path/to/csv/file that contains the functional annotations for each gene. The file should contain at least two columns, one containing the gene names ("gene_name") and one containing the functional annotations ("GOs", "pfams", "signalP", "TMHMM").}

\item{sep}{Specify the separator used to put together all (GO/PFAM) annotation terms for a given gene in a single column (usually ";" or "; "). The default is ";"}

\item{gene_col}{What is the name of the column that contains the gene names in the user-specified annotation file? By default, the program expects your gene names to be in a column called "gene_name".}

\item{org}{Organisms for which annotation files are included in the package. Choose between "cflo" (camponotus floridanus), "ophio_cflo" (ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani), "ophio_kim" (ophiocordyceps kimflemingiae), and "beau" (beauveria bassiana)}

\item{bg}{A character vector of gene names that make up the background universe against which enrichment is run for geneset. The default uses all genes present in the species' genome.}

\item{FDR}{The threshold false discovery rate to infer significance. Default is 5.}

\item{atleast}{Run enrichments only for annotations that are present in at least "atleast" (default is 5) of all background genes.}

\item{verbose}{Default is FALSE. If set to TRUE, prints summary statistics.}

\item{plot}{Default is TRUE. Plots the results of the enrichment analyses.}

\item{n_trunc}{If plot is TRUE, n_trunc specifies the number of characters in the description of the annotation that is printed on the plot.}

\item{clean}{If plot is TRUE, clean = F will get rid of additional labels from the plot}

\item{filter}{Default is TRUE. Filters to keep only significantly overrepresented terms at the specified FDR.}

\item{simple}{Default is TRUE. Retains only the most relevant columns for the enrichment result.}

\item{expand}{If set to TRUE, will return a long-formatted table of the filtered and simplified enrichment result.}
