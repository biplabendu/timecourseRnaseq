\title{Subset dataframe based on expression thresholds}
\usage{
subset_data(data, id_column, min_expression, min_timepoints)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe. One of the columns should contain unique gene
(feature) IDs or names, and other columns should contain expression
levels across timepoints.}

\item{id_column}{character of length one. Name of the column which
contain unique gene (feature) IDs or names, and for which a
log-transformation should not be attempted.}

\item{min_expression}{numeric of length one. Non-negative value specifying
minimum expression required for a timepoint to be counted as _valid_.}

\item{min_timepoints}{integer of length one. Non-negative value specifying
the minimum number of _valid_ timepoints, where the expression level must
meet or exceed the value specified in `min_expression`.}
}
\value{
dataframe with rows filtered based on the expression threshold
  and timepoint count.
}
\description{
This function filters a data frame to include rows where the expression
level exceeds a specified threshold (`min_expression`) in at least a given
number of timepoints (`min_timepoints`). It allows specifying the column
representing unique IDs (default is `gene_name`).
}
\note{
If duplicates exist in the `id_column`, will retain only the first
occurrence of each unique ID.
