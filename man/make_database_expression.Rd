\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with gene names in first column and time-series
expression data in remaining columns.}

\item{path_to_csv}{Path to a CSV file with gene names in first column and
time-series expression data in remaining columns. Default set to `NULL`}

\item{header}{Specifies if the file has a header or not.
Either `TRUE` or `FALSE.` Default set to `TRUE`.}

\item{timepoints}{A numeric vector of time points that correspond to the
time-series data.}

\item{expressed_timepoints_min}{Minimum number of timepoints that need to
have at least 1 unit expression for a gene to be considered `expressed`.}

\item{cycle}{The light-dark conditions in which samples were collected.
Either `LD` or `DD`. Default set to `LD`.}

\item{db_name}{The prefix to be used for the database tables created.
By default, the db_name is set to `database`.}
}
\value{
Creates and connects to a local SQL database with four tables:
\enumerate{
   \item Input gene expression
   \item Expressed genes
   \item Log-transformed gene expression
   \item Z-scored gene expression
}
