\title{Perform network topology analysis to pick soft-thresholding power.}
\usage{
analyze_network_topology(data, max_power = 21, height = 0.9, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing gene expression data, where
each column represent genes, rows represent sequential time points.
Intended for output of `transpose_data()`.}

\item{max_power}{Integer specifying the maximum possible value for the
soft-thresholding power (default = 21)}

\item{height}{Real number specifying the signed R^2 of the
correlation between sample means and the corresponding row means in the
network topology matrix (default = 0.9)}

\item{plot}{Logical indicating whether to plot the results from the
network topology analysis (default = TRUE).
If true calls `plot_network_topology()`.}
}
\value{
listObject containing the optimized soft-thresholding power
}
\description{
This function analyzes the network topology and uses it to determine optimal
soft-thresholding power. The results are also visualized as a plot.
